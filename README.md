# FallingTicTacToe
Not the regular tic tac toe game.

The game was made with Qt c++ as an university project.

Players only need to select a column, and the symbols falling from the top of that until they can. The objective is to get 4 symbols next to each other, or in a diagonal way. The game can be saved and loaded also.

Includes a simple testing by mocking save/load functions.
